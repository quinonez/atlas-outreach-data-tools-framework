## About
This is the analysis code that may be used to analyse the data of the ATLAS published dataset.

## Setup
After checking out the repository, go to the root-folder of your installation and do the following:

> mkdir Output  
> mkdir Input

Having set up the initial folder structure you can then populate the _Input_ folder with the files from the dataset (contact Felix Socher for access to the 
dataset). The provided zip-file should be placed into the Input folder and unzipped via

> unzip ATLASDataSet.zip

## General Usage
### Analysis
The files in the root directory of the installation are the various run scripts. Configuration files can be found in the Configurations folder. 

As a first test you can simply run a preconfigured analyis via

>     python RunScript.py 

The runscript has several options which may be displayed by typing

>     python RunScript.py --help

The options include:

>     -p,            --parallel              enables running in parallel (default is single core use)
>     -n NWORKERS,   --nWorkers NWORKERS     specifies the number of workers if multi core usage is desired (default is 4)
>     -c CONFIGFILE, --configfile CONFIGFILE specifies the config file to be read (default is Configurations/Configuration.py)

The Configuration.py file specifies how an analysis should behave. The Job portion of the configuration looks like this:

>      Job = {
>          "Batch"           : True,              (switches progress bar on and off, forced to be off when running in parallel mode)
>          "Analysis"        : "TTbarAnalysis",   (names the analysis to be executed)
>          "Fraction"        : 1,                 (determines the fraction of events per file to be analysed)
>          "MaxEvents"       : 1234567890,        (determines the maximum number of events per file to be analysed)
>          "OutputDirectory" : "results/"         (specifies the directory where the output root files should be saved)
>      }

The second portion of the configuration file specifies which 
The locations of the individual files that are to be used for the different 
processes can be set es such:

>     Processes = {
>         # Diboson processes
>         "WW"                    : "Input/MC/mc_105985.WW.root",  (single file)
>         ...
>         "data_Egamma"           : "Input/Data/DataEgamma*.root", (potentially many files)
>     }

The files associated with the processes are found via python's glob module, enabling the use of unix style wildcards.

The names chosen for the processes are important as they are the keys that are used later in the _infofile.py_ to determine the necessary 
scaling factors for correct plotting. 

Execution times are between 1 to 1.5 hours in single core mode or ~ 15 minutes in multi core mode.

### Plotting

Results may be plotted via:

> python PlotResults.py Configuration/PlotConf\_<AnalysisName>.py

The resulting histograms will be put into the _Output_ directory.

The plotting configuration file enables the user to steer the plotting process.
Each analysis has its own plotting configuration file to accomodate changes in background composition or histograms that the user may want to plot.

General information for plotting include the _Luminosity_ and _InputDirectory_ located at the top of the file:

>       config = {
>           "Luminosity"     : 1000,
>           "InputDirectory" : "results",
>           ...

The names of the histograms to be drawn can be specified like so: 

>      "Histograms" : {
>          "etmiss"          : {rebin : 4, log_y : True},
>          "lep_n"           : {rebin : 5},
>          "lep_pt"          : {},
>      ...

Note that it is possible to supply additional information via a dictionary like structure to further detail the per histogram options.
Currently available options are:

>     rebin    : int   - used to merge X bins into one. Useful in low statistics situations
>     log_y    : bool  - if True is set as the bool the main depiction will be drawn in logarithmic scale
>     y_margin : float - sets the fraction of whitespace above the largest contribution in the plot. Default value is 0.1.

# Definition of Paintables and Depictions
Each Plot consists of several _depictions_ of _paintables_.
A depiction is a certain standard type of visualising information. Availabe depictions include simple plots, ratios and agreement plots.
A paintable is a histogram or stack with added information such as colors and which processes contribute to said histogram.
A simple definition of paintables may look like this:

>     'Paintables': {
>         "Stack": {
>             "Order"     : ["Diboson", "DrellYan", "W", "Z", "stop", "ttbar"],
>             "Processes" : {                
>                 "Diboson" : {
>                     "Color"         : "#fa7921",
>                     "Contributions" : ["WW", "WZ", "ZZ"]},
>                                     
>                 "DrellYan": {       
>                     "Color"         : "#5bc0eb",
>                     "Contributions" : ["DYeeM08to15", "DYeeM15to40", "DYmumuM08to15", "DYmumuM15to40", "DYtautauM08to15", "DYtautauM15to40"]},
>                 ...
>         },
>     
>         'Higgs': {
>             'Color': '#0000ff', 
>             'Contributions': ['ggH125_WW2lep']},
>                 
>         "data" : {
>             "Contributions": ["data_Egamma", "data_Muons"]}

_Stack_ and _data_ are specialised names for _paintables_. This ensures that only one stack and one data representation are present in the visual results.
A _Stack_ shows the different processes specified in "order" stacked upon each other to give an idea of the composition of the simulated data.
The definitions for these individual processes are defined under "Processes". Each process has a certain colour and a list of contributing parts 
that comprise it. These contributing parts have to fit the keys used in both the run configuration and the _infofile.py_.

_data_ is a specialised _paintable_ which is geared toward the standard representation of data. Since the data does not need to be scaled there is no need
to align the used names in contributions with those found in the _infofile.py_. However, they still have to fit the ones used in the _configuration.py_.

All otherwise named paintables (like "Higgs" in the example) are considered as "overlays". Overlays are used to show possible signals or to compare shapes
between multiple overlays (see for instance in the ZPrimeAnalysis).

The paintables can be used in depictions like so:

>     "Depictions": {
>         "Order"       : ["Main", "Data/MC", "Z`Ratio"],
>         "Definitions" : {
>             "Data/MC": {
>                 "type"       : "Agreement",
>                 "Paintables" : ["data", "Stack"]},
>             
>             "Main": {
>                 "type"      : "Main",
>                 "Paintables": ["Stack", "data"]},
>     
>             'Z`Ratio': {
>                 'type'       : 'Ratio',
>                 'Paintables' : ['ZPrime1000', 'ZPrime500']},
>         }


There are currently three types of depictions available: _Main_, _Agreement_ and _Ratio_.
Main type plots will simply show the paintables in a simple plot fashion.
Ratio type plots will show the ratio of the first paintable w.r.t. the second paintable.
Agreement type plots are typically used to evaluate the agreement between two paintables (usually the stack of predictions and the data).

The order of the depictions is determined in line 2 of the code example above.

## In Depth Information

### Analysis Code
The analysis code is located in the _Analysis_ folder.
It will be used to write out histograms for the individual input files which
will be used for plotting purposes later.

The basic code implementing the protocol to read the files and how the objects can be read is in _Tuplereader.py_.
Have a look there to see which information is available.
The general analysis flow can be found in _Job.py_ whereas the base class for all concrete analyses is located in  _Analysis.py_.

It is recommended to start out by modifying one of the existing analyses, e.g. the ZAnalysis located in _ZAnalysis.py_.
If you want to add an analysis, make sure that the filename is the same as the class name, otherwise the code will not work.
